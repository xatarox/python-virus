# python-virus
Well hello there!
I'm aTAR!, just a teenager loving python.
Here is my first project that I post on GitHub, a python virus.

It is not a real python virus though, just a little fun program. Nothing will happen to your computer if you launch it, 
I mean, nothing that will destroy your computer.
All it will do is get your ip address, change background, control your mouse and keyboard, and opening 200 windows of the app you want (here it is CMD).

I plan to make a real virus out of it, like actually getting usernames and password etc... but my lack of competences makes it impossible for me (yet)
to make this version, so feel free to make it better!
Create a pull request and we can talk about it!
